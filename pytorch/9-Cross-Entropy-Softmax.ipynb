    "The multi-class SVM loss, also known as the multiclass hinge loss, is a commonly used loss function in machine learning for training support vector machine (SVM) models to perform multi-class classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the multi-class SVM loss is to encourage the correct class score to be higher than the scores of all other classes by a margin. It computes the difference between the scores of the correct class and the scores of all other classes and applies a hinge loss function to penalize any violation of the margin.\n",
